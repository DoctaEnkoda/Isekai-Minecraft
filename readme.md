# TenseiMC

</div>


TenseiMC is a drop-in replacement for [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) which is a [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) Fork. It is designed to allow server creators to modify gameplay through configurations with the power of Folia.

TenseiMC is not stable at all and bugs are to be expected. Also, like [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia), most plugins on the Spigot markets may not work!
